![Me]({{ site.url }}/assets/Jimmy.jpg)

I’m a Firmware Architect at Eaton’s Cooper Power Systems division. In this role, I am responsible for embedded software architecture for the controls group with a focus on new product development. I have the opportunity of overseeing and working with three distributed scrum teams.

Even though I have worked within the same controls group over the last seven years, I have held roles of increasing responsibility. Each of these roles have been very rewarding and allowed me to grow and hone my skills in embedded development and gain a deeper understanding of the electric grid as a whole.

Recently, I have focused on clean and efficient code techniques with a strong emphasis on self documenting code. I am a firm believer that complex sections of code can be made efficient and easy to understand. When code is written in this way, it makes bringing new engineers onto a team easier and finding issues more trivial.

I have a BS from the University Of Wisconsin - Platteville with a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Mathematics.

I enjoy hearing from old friends, like-minded engineers, and others within the industry, so feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.
